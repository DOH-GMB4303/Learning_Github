# MAGIC Why use it?
# MAGIC - We use GitHub because it allows fine grained version control. Version control is useful because it permits multiple users to work on a code base without affecting other user's work.

# MAGIC Step 1. Commit this to the repo as our initial commit. (This was already done)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Now, imagine you would like to make a change to the code base. To do so, you first need to create a branch. Creating a branch from a repo is essentially creating a copy of the repo; we will refer to this as the "feature branch". Customarily, the production or final branch is named "main". YOU SHOULD NEVER COMMIT ANYTHING DIRECTLY TO MAIN. Rather, you should create a branch, make your changes, then push the branch to the repo. After someone approves the changes, you then merge the branch changes into the main branch. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The benefit of using this framework is that the changes you push to a repo don't affect others' work in progress.
